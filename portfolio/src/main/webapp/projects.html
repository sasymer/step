      <div class="collapsibleContent">
        <p>I am the tech and social media director for DUSO (Duke's Science
            Olympiad club that plans an annual invitational for high schoolers).
            Last year, I designed the website for DUSO, but I cheated--using Wix
            to make the website. However, now that I have a better handle in HTML...
            Maybe I'll spend some time remaking it?

      </div> 
      <h3>Java, JavaFX</h3>
      <p> 
        In a team of 3, I worked on the back-end to create a program that 
        has the ability to run any kind of grid-based simulation, including
        predator-prey, fire spreading, rock paper scissors, game of life, etc. 
        Using an inheritance hierarchy, I implemented all of the simulation 
        rules. I also created functionality in the back-end to allow for 
        various types of grid edges, such as a wrap-around grid. Additionally,
        simulations can be run on any size of cell neighborhood.

        <h3>Java, JavaFX, data-driven design, inheritance, OOP</h3>
        <p>I worked in a team of 4 to create a card game engine. The idea was to 
        create a data-driven design, allowing users to create custom card games 
        through modifying only XML and property files. I worked on the back-end, 
        implementing an inheritance hierarchy for possible actions that take 
        place in a card game (transfer card between users, select the top 
        card from the center deck, etc.). <br> Ultimately, my team created the 
        capacity for relatively simple multiplayer games such as Old Maid, Go Fish, War,
        Slapjack, etc.

        <h3>Java, JavaFX, inheritance, binding, listeners</h3>
        <p>I worked in a team of 4 to make a Logo language parser and interactive UI.
            My role was primarily in the back end, implementing various commands the 
            language can run, allowing the turtle to move around the UI, drawing lines 
            along its path. I also worked on binding between the front-end and back-end,
            as our design did not have a controller component. To do so, I used a series
            of change listeners.
