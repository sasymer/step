      <h1>Projects</h1>


      <p>On this page, I want to showcase some of the projects I've worked on 
          over the past few years. <br>For each project, I'll list the language 
          I used as well as skills learned throughout the project.
      </p>

      <div class="sectionHeader">
        <h2 class="modern" class="sectionHeader">Game Engine</h2>
      </div> 
      
      <h3>Java, JavaFX, data-driven design, inheritance, OOP</h3>
      <p>As part of my CS308 (Advanced Software Design and Implementation) class last semester, 
          I worked in a team of 4 to create a card game engine. The idea was to 
          create a data-driven design, allowing users to create custom card games 
          through modifying only XML and property files. I worked on the back-end, 
          implementing an inheritance hierarchy for possible actions that take 
          place in a card game (transfer card between users, select the top 
          card from the center deck, etc.). <br> Ultimately, my team created the 
          capacity for relatively simple multiplayer games such as Old Maid, Go Fish, War,
          Slapjack, etc.
      </p>

      <div class="sectionHeader">
        <h2 class="modern" class="sectionHeader">SLogo Parser</h2>
      </div> 
      <h3>Java, JavaFX, inheritance, binding, listeners</h3>
      <p>I worked in a team of 4 to make a Logo language parser and interactive UI.
          My role was primarily in the back end, implementing various commands the 
          language can run, allowing the turtle to move around the UI, drawing lines 
          along its path. I also worked on binding between the front-end and back-end,
          as our design did not have a controller component. To do so, I used a series
          of change listeners. 
      </p>

      <div class="sectionHeader">
        <h2 class="modern" class="sectionHeader">Cell Simulation</h2>
      </div> 
      <h3>Java, JavaFX</h3>
      <p> 
          In a team of 3, I worked on the back-end to create a program that 
          has the ability to run any kind of grid-based simulation, including
          predator-prey, fire spreading, rock paper scissors, game of life, etc. 
          Using an inheritance hierarchy, I implemented all of the simulation 
          rules. I also created functionality in the back-end to allow for 
          various types of grid edges, such as a wrap-around grid. Additionally,
          simulations can be run on any size of cell neighborhood.
