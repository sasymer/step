      <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <p>This is the fun stuff. My favorites: from food to TV and books, 
          as well as a look into my passions outside of tech.
      </p>

      <h2>Art</h2>
      <p>Ever since I can remember, I've loved to create artwork. 
          My passion for portraiture, however, started in 6th
          grade after I tried to draw Taylor Swift, quickly 
          realizing that the drawing ended up a lot like the 
          picture. <br> Since then, I've dabbled in figure 
          drawing, painting, illustration, digital art,
          and even some 3D animation (but as far as I ever got was
          animating a ball falling off a table). <br> So,
          here's some of my work! </p>

      <h2>Favorites</h2>
      <p>Of course, I must include food.</p>
      <h3>Food</h3>
      <h4>Snacks</h4>
      <ul> 
          <li>salt and vinegar chips</li>
          <li>mangos</li>
          <li>hummus</li>
          <li>popcorn</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Meals</h4>
      <ul> 
          <li>spaghetti</li>
          <li>ceviche (except I'm vegetarian now :( )</li>
          <li>poke</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Books</h3>
      <p>I used to read all the time. Then... high school happened,
          I guess, and ever since I've been "too busy" to read.
          But I still love a good book, so here's a list of 
          some of my all-time favorites.

          <dd>Yes, maybe this is kind of basic. But I have recently
              been listening to the audiobooks while drawing, and I have
              to say, the books really do take you to another world. </dd>
