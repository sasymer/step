          This was my final project for a data structures class in high school.
          I worked with a partner over about 2 weeks to complete a full
          working computer version of Monopoly. I worked mainly on the back-end, 
          while my partner worked on the front-end. Looking at the code from 
          this project now, I realize how far I've come in terms of design.
          Even though our functionality was pretty good, I now realize that
          my design was near-horrendous. I had huge methods and classes and poor variable
          names, and nearly all constants were hard-coded rather than coming 
          from a data file. Although this was my largest project up to that point,
          I use this project as an example of my old work--showing also the progress
          I've made since then.
